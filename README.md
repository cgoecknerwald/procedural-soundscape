# procedural-soundscape
02826 Sound Design for Digital Media Project

We aim to build a procedurally-generated soundscape inspired by '[coffeehouse jazz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2Q6YO3Ez44)'. The ideal end-product is jazz-esque music that can respond in live time to environmental variables. We selected jazz as our target because we believe it will be easier to procedurally generate due to the improvisational and diverse nature of jazz. We will initially follow this [Procedural Music Generation tutorial](http://www.procjam.com/tutorials/en/music/). To begin, we select a 'palette' of frequencies and sounds that function well together. Then, we will add rhythm and beat to generate our base product. After this is accomplished, we may add additional complexities such as palette-changes, instrument modifications, etc. We may additionally attempt to link these complexities to environmental variables for an interactive soundscape.
